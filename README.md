# Frank Turner Gigs Analysis

## Description
A small project to scrape Frank Turner's website and analyse his gigs for both solo and side projects, using R. And make some pretty plots along the way! 

## Analysis
With over 3000 shows to his name, Franks has averaged over 150 gigs a year since he first began playing in 2004! It's interesting how the data clearly shows the impact of the pandemic, and also the frenzied cramming in of gigs before a big milestone concert.

It may be interesting to plot gigs on a map. Such unanswered questions like, where in the world hasn't Frank played. If Frank was a snail, how far would he have travelled? Watch this space!
