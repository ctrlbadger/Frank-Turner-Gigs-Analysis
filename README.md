# Frank Turner Gigs Analysis

## Description

A small project to scrape Frank Turner's website and analyse his gigs for both solo and side projects, using R. And make some pretty plots along the way!

## Analysis

With over 3000 shows to his name, Franks has averaged over 150 gigs a year since he first began playing in 2004! Franks busiest years were 2009 with 210 gigs followed by 2010 (206) and and 2013 (196).

It's interesting how the data clearly shows the impact of the pandemic, and also the frenzied cramming in of gigs before a big milestone concert. ![alt text](https://github.com/ctrlbadger/Frank-Turner-Gigs-Analysis/blob/master/assets/FrankTurnerGigsbyProject.png?raw=true)

The most Gigs in one day was on 26th of June 2009 where Frank performed 19 times around London! Second only to the 5th May 2024 with 8 gigs in one day, and 7 the day before that.

The most popular days for gigs were Friday 553 gigs, Sat 558 gigs followed by Thursday (454) then Sunday (437). Frank has performed solo in the UK 1171 times, 933 times in the US, 227 times in Germany and 145 times in Canada.

It may be interesting to plot gigs on a map. Such unanswered questions like, where in the world hasn't Frank played. If Frank was a snail, how far would he have travelled? Watch this space!
